To install as a service on systemd 

extract this folder to /opt/udraw
ln -s /opt/udraw/udraw.service /etc/systemd/system/udraw.service
systemctl enable udraw.service
systemctl daemon-reload
service udraw start

Or if you do not want a systemd service just run driver.py, to run as a normal user you need access to /dev/uniput (usually given by plugdev group) and access to the Arduino serial (usually dialout group)
